	the royals' or 'Light of the Crown'.<br/><br/>Skrell are a highly advanced and logical race who live under the rule \
	of the Qerr'Katish, a caste within their society which keeps the empire of the Skrell running smoothly. Skrell are \
	herbivores on the whole and tend to be co-operative with the other species of the galaxy, although they rarely reveal \
